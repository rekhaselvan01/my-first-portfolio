# my-first-portfolio : version one

In this first version, I have designed a website with basic css properties. It's a bare skeleton website. The purpose of this version is to see how a webpage can be tranformed from skeleton form. I have not used any advanced CSS properties such as flexbox, mediascreen and css variables...the above features will be applied in version two.


Design aspect::
I have designed a website which is pretty basic with a header footer element. 
It has  a nav bar where the name appears on left side and links appear on right side.
It has a section with a subtitle
It has a section about me with a paragraph description
It has four section where each section has an image in place of a link to delployed app.
It has a footer with all the contact info.


Functional aspect::
1. The webpage is launched correctly without error.
2. The links in the nav bar are functional. 
The about me link takes to paragraph abtout me.
The work link takes me to first image.
the contact link takes me to footer.
the resume links correctly downloads the resume.

When you click on the first image, it takes to my github repository representing my first deployed app..

Second and final version:
I have designed a website for my first portfolio.It has the following webelements and functionalities.
Design::
1. A header on left side of page.
2. A nav bar with links appearing on right side.
3. A section with photo of me and cool title on side.
4. A section with about me and a little paragraph describing about me.
5. A section with work and and another div called flex-container.
6. The flex-container had two sections. first section with latest work and second section with previous works.
7. A footer section with contact me on side and all my details as footer.

Functionality:
1. nav bar and links are working perfectly.
2. when i click on my latest work it works perfectly taking me to the latest github proj.
3.When i reduce screen size, the nav links appear in block and flex-container and images appear in block and reduced in size.

Design methodology
1. Tried to create each web element and add css properties respectively. 
2. Tried to apply flex properties to webelements.
3. Applied media screen queries to control the way the website looks in different devices.

Area of improvement:
I am still not satisfied with the way the website looks. 
1. Needs more improvement in adjusting media screen with smartphones 
2. Need more improvement in displaying work areas.. flex container.
3. overall aesthetic look can be improved drastically.
